# 🖼️ Image Uploader to AWS S3

Image Uploader to S3 is a web application built using React and Node.js that allows users to upload images to an <b>Amazon S3 bucket</b>. The application provides a user interface for selecting and uploading images, and displays a gallery of all uploaded images.

📌The frontend of the application is built using React and Chakra UI, and allows users to select and upload images in JPG or PNG format. The application uses a custom hook to communicate with the backend API built using Node.js and Express.js.

📌The backend API is responsible for authenticating users and generating pre-signed URLs for uploading images to the S3 bucket. It uses AWS SDK for Node.js to communicate with the S3 bucket and generate pre-signed URLs. The API also provides endpoints for retrieving all images uploaded by a user, deleting an image, and updating the metadata of an image.
